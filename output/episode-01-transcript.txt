[00:00:00] Hey there, welcome back for another DeepDive. Today, we're going beyond the usual job hunting advice and looking at something, more foundational, high income skills. Exactly. We're not just talking about specific jobs.
We're talking about building a skillset that makes you so valuable. No matter what you decide to do. And to kind of guide us on this journey, we are going to be, pulling from the wisdom of Ali Abdaal and a couple of his YouTube videos. five high income skills for students to learn in 2025.
Okay. And, how to achieve your goals in 2025. Cool. And he introduces this really interesting concept of personal stock price. Everyone's kind of like an entrepreneur selling their abilities and your personal stock price is really reflecting like what you bring to the table.
It really makes you think like, okay, what am I doing every day to actually increase that worth? Absolutely. And he makes this distinction between, High income skills and low income skills. and he argues that it's not just about having a skill.
[00:01:00] It's about having a skill that's in demand by the right market. So for example, like playing guitar beautifully might be a fantastic hobby. Right. But, it's unlikely to, like, generate the same income as coding unless you reach, you know, rock star status, of course. Of course. But yeah, I mean, it's like.
You could be the best guitar player in the world, but if no one's paying you to play guitar, then it doesn't really matter, right? Doesn't pay the bills, yeah. Exactly. You got to get paid. And he emphasizes the importance of selling to businesses, which we call B2B, rather than individual consumer.
Right, B2C. Or B2C, yeah. And he uses this analogy of a guitar teacher versus a musician with a record deal. Okay. So, the guitar teacher is selling their skills directly to students, which is B2C. The musician leverages their guitar skills to land a deal with a record label. Right. That's B2B. The latter has the potential for, like, significantly higher earnings because, [00:02:00] businesses have more buying power.
Okay. So, with that in mind, let's dive into those five high income skills that Abdaal highlights. Let's do it. First up, we have a software consultant. Ooh, interesting. Now, this one might seem surprising at first. Yeah, I could see that. it might sound a bit unexpected, but think about it. 
Businesses are increasingly reliant on software like Notion, HubSpot, Asana to, streamline their operations and they're often willing to pay top dollar for someone who can not only use these tools effectively, but also train their teams. He even shares the story of Melina, a student who built a lucrative consulting business around Notion, while she was still in college.
So, basically, she taught herself the software and then figured out how to solve problems for businesses using it. And, what's interesting about Melina's story isn't just that she learned a piece of software. It's that she identified a real market need. Yeah. And honed her [00:03:00] skills to a high level. Right.
And packaged them into a service that businesses were eager to pay for. It's like the perfect storm. You know, you find a need, you learn the skills, you put it together. Next, we have copywriting. This one's all about harnessing the power of words to drive sales and conversions. 
Think about it. Every website, every ad, every piece of marketing material relies on copywriting. and he gives a really compelling example of how. Even small improvements in conversion rates can translate into huge revenue gains for businesses. For those who might not be familiar, a conversion rate is basically the percentage of people who take a desired action.
Like clicking a button, signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase. So let's say a company's website has a 1 percent conversion rate. That means For every 100 visitors, one person makes a purchase. Now imagine a skilled copywriter comes in, tweaks the wording on the [00:04:00] website, bumping that conversion rate up to just 2%.
That's double the sales. For the same amount of traffic. Huge difference. So suddenly, businesses are getting a much higher return on their investment. And that's why they're willing to pay a premium for skilled copywriters. Abdal recommends Jim Edwards book, Copywriting Secrets, as a resource for those who are interested in diving deeper.
The third skill he highlights is design, both web and graphic. And this one is in high demand across pretty much every industry. It really is. Yeah, you can't really escape good design these days. Not at all, it's everywhere. Websites, social media, marketing materials, product interfaces, it's everywhere.
He actually tells this story about his own brother struggling to find a good product designer. Even with a salary of 400, 000. So, it's a good example of how the demand for skilled designers often outstrips the supply. 
If you have a natural talent for visual communication, and you enjoy creating [00:05:00] aesthetically pleasing and user friendly designs, this could be a really great path. Yeah, definitely. To explore, he mentions Abbey Connick's YouTube channel as a good starting point for aspiring designers. Great resource. Okay, the fourth high income skill on Abdal's list is website building.
It's about being able to create websites that are not only visually appealing, but also functional. Right. User friendly. Yeah. And optimized for conversions. All those things. He emphasizes the value of being a so called unicorn.
Unicorn. Oh, I like that. Someone who can both design and develop websites. Yeah, that's powerful. That makes you a one stop shop for businesses looking to establish a strong online presence. Makes sense. He mentions Webflow and Framer as powerful tools for building sophisticated websites without needing to be a coding expert.
he shares another inspiring story. This time about his friend Henry. Henry taught himself web design in six months using online resources. And now charges thousands of dollars per [00:06:00] website for businesses. That's amazing. It just goes to show that with the right resources and dedication.
You can acquire these skills and start building a profitable career. He even mentions Hostinger as a good option for, affordable web hosting. And last but certainly not least. Here we go. We have coding. The big one. This one probably comes as no surprise. We all know there's a huge demand for coders.
And the earning potential is through the roof. But what's really encouraging is how accessible learning to code has become. There are so many free resources available online. From YouTube tutorials to interactive platforms. There's no excuse anymore. And with AI tools like GitHub Copilot.
Oh yeah, those are game changers. Coding is becoming even more beginner friendly. Totally. These tools can assist with writing code, suggesting solutions, and help catch errors, making the learning process much smoother. Yeah, and for those who need a little extra motivation, he shares the story of his friend, Sahel.
Who [00:07:00] taught himself to code and ended up building a successful video editing software. Cool. That now brings in 35, 000 per month. Wow. That's incredible. He recommends checking out the website IndieHackers for inspiration from other coders who've built profitable businesses. Oh, that's a good one.
So we've got all these amazing skills and it's like how do we actually go about right developing them, you know that's where that second YouTube video we mentioned how to achieve your goals comes in. he goes beyond like the typical surface level advice and backs up his strategies with actual scientific research.
One of the, simplest yet most powerful things he talks about is the act of writing down your goals. Writing them down. But there's a study from Dominican University. That found people who write down their goals are 42 percent more likely to achieve them.
42%? That's significant. It's like this weird mind trick that actually works. It is! It's like, you know, you [00:08:00] write it down and it's like, almost like you're making a contract with yourself. Yeah. Actually do it. Yeah, it's not just a trick. It has to do with activating a part of our brain called the reticular activating system.
Oh, wow. The RAS acts like a filter, deciding what information gets our attention. When you write down your goals, you're essentially sending a memo to your RAS saying, Hey, this is important. Keep an eye out for anything related to this. I like that. Yeah, you're priming your brain.
It's like that thing where you decide you want to buy a certain car and suddenly you start seeing that car everywhere you go. Oh, yeah, totally. It's not that there are suddenly more of those cars on the road. Right. It's just your brain is now tuned in to notice them. Yeah, exactly. It's like you've put up a mental filter.
And Abdal recommends reviewing your written goals. Regularly, ideally every week, just to keep them fresh in your mind and leverage the power of your RAS. Yeah, keep it top of mind. He also suggests this cool method called quarterly quests, which is basically setting three to four major [00:09:00] goals for each quarter.
Oh, I like that. And helps break down those, like, big, overwhelming goals into, smaller, more manageable chunks. bite sized pieces. Yeah, and it's a smart approach because it creates a sense of momentum. And keeps you from getting bogged down by the sheer scale of your ambitions. Even just a few minutes each day or week dedicated to reviewing and reflecting on your goals can make a huge difference.
It really can. Consistency is key. And he dives into this, really interesting technique called mental contrasting, which involves not only visualizing your desired outcome, but also anticipating potential obstacles. Oh, that's smart. So it's not just about picturing yourself crossing the finish line.
Right. It's about mentally preparing for the hurdles. Mm hmm. That you might encounter along the way. Makes you more resilient. Yeah. And Abdal suggests using the, WHOOP method. WHOOP. Wish Outcome Obstacle Plan. WHOOP. Hey, I love it. So you [00:10:00] start by defining your wish and the desired outcome. Okay. Then you brainstorm potential obstacles that could get in your way.
And finally, you create a plan to overcome each obstacle. For example, if your goal is to write a book. Okay. A potential obstacle might be finding the time to write consistently. So your plan might be to block off specific hours in your calendar for writing.
Mm hmm. Or maybe join a writing group for accountability and support. Yeah, that's a good idea. By proactively addressing Those potential obstacles. You're increasing your chances of success. Absolutely. And the last strategy he highlights is tying your goals to your identity. Oh, that's powerful. This one's about aligning your goals with who you want to be.
I like it. So, for example, instead of just saying, I want to lose weight. Right. You might say, I have a healthy person who makes choices that support my well being. Yeah, that's a good one. It's a subtle shift in language, but it can have a powerful impact. It can. It's about changing your mindset. [00:11:00] On your motivation.
Yeah, exactly. When you start to identify with a certain characteristic, you're more likely to act in ways that are consistent with that identity. Absolutely. He even talks about how embracing the identity of YouTuber helped him stay consistent. With creating videos, even when he was facing challenges or self doubt.
Yeah, so it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. If you believe you're a writer, you're more likely to write. If you believe you're an entrepreneur. You're more likely to take those actions. He even ties this back to a quote from Tony Robbins. The strongest force in human personality is the need to stay consistent with how we define ourselves.
Oh, that's good. It is. So how does all of this tie back to, like, personal stock price and those high income skills? Yeah, it's all interconnected. As you think about the skills you want to develop, consider how you can tie those aspirations to your identity. I like that. Do you see yourself as a problem solver?
A creative innovator. Yeah. A tech savvy [00:12:00] master of efficiency. All good things. Embrace those identities and watch how they fuel your actions and propel you towards your goals. Totally.
